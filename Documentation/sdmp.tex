\chapter{Project Overview}
% brief description of the whole project
\indent  \indent The Agents will be available on both MS-Windows and Ubuntu Linux systems. When running the software, Agents it will collect data of CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and service applications that are currently running. Those data will be send to a monitor engine and get store in to a database. The end user will be allow to see those data report on a dashboard. \newline \newline
\indent The Agent will access the data one the hardware if the computer we are working on. The data we will be looking for and accessing will be the CPU, disk, memory, and network. We plan to use Python and take advantage of the modules that Python has. As well as taking advantage of the data transfer modules to be able to send our information over either TCP or UDP to get the data to the next step.

\section{Software Overview}
